Hi, Iâ€™m Alex, my GitHub is @Alexgithubnyc
I am an entry level Python developer seeking remote or hybrid entry level Python developer work in Data Analysis. 
I took a Python bootcamp and looking to work in a field using this language 
I am continuously learning Python. It would be a level up to collaborate in Machine Learning, to collaborate on App Development and a small new data project.

You can find my work here! As of 8/22/2022 4:34 PM I am adding two projects to my Git. One is an (a) Alien Invasion Project from my Python Crash Course study and two (b) Zillow WebScraper Project that I found in my study from an instructor on youtube!

If you want to get in touch. Reach me at my e-mail:
