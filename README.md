Hi, Iâ€™m Alex, my GitHub is @Alexgithubnyc
I am an entry level Python developer seeking remote or hybrid entry level Python developer work in Data Analysis. 
I took a Python bootcamp and looking to work in a field using this language 
I am continiously learning Python. It would be a level up to collaborate in Machine Learning, to collaborate on App Development and a small new data project.
